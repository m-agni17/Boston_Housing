            INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
            CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
            NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
            RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
            AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
            DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
